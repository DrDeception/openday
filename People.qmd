## What is People-Watching?

::: r-fit-text
> "I like to watch people. Sometimes I ride the subway all day and look at them and listen to them. I just want to figure out who they are and what they want and where they're going."
:::

::: attribution
â€” Ray Bradbury, *Fahrenheit 451*
:::

::: notes
-   Start by asking students if they've ever people-watched
-   Explain that this common pastime is actually a sophisticated cognitive process
:::

## More Than Just a Pastime {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1533779283484-8ad4940aa3a8?q=80&w=1000" background-opacity="0.4"}

People-watching is **central to our social existence**

-   We observe others to gather information
-   We form impressions within seconds
-   Our brains are wired to analyze social interactions
-   These impressions affect how we interact with others

::: notes
-   Emphasize that people-watching isn't just entertainment
-   It's a fundamental cognitive skill that helps us navigate our social world
-   Ask students when they might people-watch (cafes, airports, school hallways)
:::

## The Science of "Third-Party Encounters" {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional Research**

-   Focused on impressions of isolated individuals
-   Usually just faces or single people
-   Missed the complexity of social interactions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**New Research Direction**

-   Studies how we observe interactions between others
-   Views interactions as the unit of analysis
-   Recognizes the richness of encounter-based impressions
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Explain that "Third-Party Encounters" (TPEs) is the scientific term for watching people interact
-   Mention that this is a relatively new and exciting area of research
:::

## Brain Game: Reading Social Clues

What clues do we use when people-watching? Let's see how many you can identify!

-   Physical appearances and facial expressions
-   Body language and proximity
-   Gestures and eye contact
-   Speaking patterns and tone
-   Actions and reactions
-   **Can you think of others?**

::: notes
-   Make this interactive - ask students to volunteer additional cues they use
-   Have them discuss with a partner how they "read" other people
:::

## What Can We Actually Tell from Watching? {background-color="#3E2F5B"}

-   Joint vs. independent actions
-   Power dynamics and social status
-   Level of intimacy and rapport
-   Emotional states and attitudes
-   Type of relationship (strangers, friends, family)
-   Cultural norms and violations

::: notes
-   Explain each item with examples relevant to high school students
-   E.g., how can you tell who's popular, who's dating, who's arguing?
:::

## Our Brains on People-Watching {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559757175-7cb05f6d89e5?q=80&w=1000" background-opacity="0.3"}

Three brain networks work together:

1.  **Person Perception Network**: Processes faces and bodies
2.  **Action Perception Network**: Understands actions and movements
3.  **Mentalizing Network**: Interprets mental states and intentions

::: notes
-   Explain in simple terms how our brains have specialized systems for social perception
-   Compare to having different apps that work together on a phone
:::

## The Marketing Connection

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Companies like Coca-Cola use our people-watching instincts in advertisements:

-   Show intimate moments between people
-   Trigger our social analysis systems
-   Make us feel connected to the product
-   Leverage our desire to be part of positive interactions
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Coca-Cola ad showing social connection](https://i.imgur.com/example.jpg)
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Discuss how ads often show people interacting rather than just the product
-   Ask students to recall ads that use social scenarios to sell products
:::

## Quick Activity: Spot the Relationship

*As I show each image, write down:*

1.  What type of relationship do you think these people have?
2.  How do you know?
3.  What clues are you using?

::: notes
-   Show 3-4 images of different interactions (friends, romantic partners, strangers, etc.)
-   Have students jot down observations and discuss with a partner
-   Then discuss as a group, noting common patterns in observations
:::

## Are We Actually Good at People-Watching? {background-color="#254441"}

-   Consider cultural and contextual factors
-   Be aware of your own biases and expectations
-   Look for details in behavior and responses

::: notes
-   Frame people-watching as a skill that can be developed
-   Emphasize the ethical aspects (respect for privacy, avoiding judgmentalism)
:::

## The Future of People-Watching Research

**Exciting new directions:**

-   Cross-cultural studies of social perception
-   How virtual interactions change our people-watching abilities
-   Neural mechanisms of real-time social analysis
-   How our social perceptions influence our behavior
-   Using VR to study encounter-based impressions

::: notes
-   Highlight that this is a growing field with many unanswered questions
-   Mention opportunities for students interested in psychology, neuroscience, or sociology
:::

## Why This Matters

People-watching is more than entertainment:

-   It helps us understand complex social dynamics
-   It provides a window into how our brains process social information
-   It reveals biases and cultural differences in perception
-   It connects to fundamental questions about what makes us human
-   It has countless applications in the real world

::: notes
-   Wrap up by emphasizing the significance of this research
-   Connect back to students' everyday experiences
:::

## Try It Yourself!

2.  Record your observations and impressions
3.  Note what specific cues led to your conclusions
4.  Reflect on any assumptions you might have made
5.  Compare notes with friends - did they notice the same things?

::: notes
-   Provide a simple, ethical activity students can try
-   Emphasize respectful observation in public places only
-   Suggest they might notice new things after this presentation

## Experimental Paradigms {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553835973-dec43bfddbeb?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1770&q=80" background-opacity="0.2"}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Encounter Categorization Task**

-   Participants classify interactions into types
-   Measures accuracy and response time
-   Example categories:
    -   Cooperative vs. competitive
    -   Formal vs. intimate
    -   Dominant vs. equal status
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Encounter Prediction Task**

-   Participants predict how an interaction will unfold
-   View partial information (beginning of interaction)
-   Predict next actions or relationship outcomes
-   Tests understanding of social dynamics
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   These paradigms measure how accurately people can "read" social situations
-   Explain that reaction time gives insight into automatic vs. deliberate processing

:::

## The "Thin Slices" Methodology {background-color="#0F3057"}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**How it works:** \* Observers view brief (10-30 second) clips of interactions \* Make judgments about relationships, traits, or outcomes \* Judgments are compared to actual outcomes or self-reports \* Measures the accuracy of rapid social perception

**Key research question:** How much social information can we extract from minimal exposure?

**Research Questions:** \* Are some social perceptions universal? \* How do cultural norms affect interpretation? \* Which cues are culturally specific? \* Can people accurately read interactions from other cultures?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Methodology:** \* Show identical interactions to people from different cultures \* Compare perception accuracy across cultures \* Analyze culture-specific interpretation biases \* Test for universal vs. culture-specific cues
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Place et al. (2012) found that detecting romantic interest is a cross-cultural ability
-   Some social cues appear to be universal, while others are culturally specific
-   This methodology helps separate innate from learned aspects of social perception
:::

## The Two-Strategy Hypothesis {background-color="#1A1A2E"}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**How do we process social interactions?**

**Feature-Based Processing** \* Extract specific visual components \* Analyze individual cues (e.g., number of smiles) \* Process components separately \* Build up interpretation from parts

**Template-Based Processing** \* Compare to stored patterns of typical interactions \* Process interactions holistically \* Use prior expectations to guide perception \* Recognize patterns from minimal information
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

**Research Findings:** \* 6-month-olds notice "irrational" interactions \* 12-month-olds have expectations about social goals \* 18-month-olds imitate observed interactions \* Social perception develops before language
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Explain each methodology (e.g., babies look longer at unexpected events)
-   These methods reveal that social perception is present very early in development
