## What is People-Watching?

::: r-fit-text
> "I like to watch people. Sometimes I ride the subway all day and look at them and listen to them. I just want to figure out who they are and what they want and where they're going."
:::

— Ray Bradbury, *Fahrenheit 451*
:::

::: notes
-   Start by asking students if they've ever people-watched
-   Explain that this common pastime is actually a sophisticated cognitive process

## More Than Just a Pastime {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1533779283484-8ad4940aa3a8?q=80&w=1000" background-opacity="0.4"}

People-watching is **central to our social existence**

-   We observe others to gather information
-   We form impressions within seconds
-   Our brains are wired to analyze social interactions
-   These impressions affect how we interact with others

::: notes
-   Emphasize that people-watching isn't just entertainment
-   It's a fundamental cognitive skill that helps us navigate our social world
-   Ask students when they might people-watch (cafes, airports, school hallways)
:::

## The Science of "Third-Party Encounters" {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional Research**

-   Focused on impressions of isolated individuals
-   Usually just faces or single people
-   Missed the complexity of social interactions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**New Research Direction**

-   Studies how we observe interactions between others
-   Views interactions as the unit of analysis
-   Recognizes the richness of encounter-based impressions
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Explain that "Third-Party Encounters" (TPEs) is the scientific term for watching people interact
-   Mention that this is a relatively new and exciting area of research
:::

## Brain Game: Reading Social Clues

What clues do we use when people-watching? Let's see how many you can identify!

-   Physical appearances and facial expressions
-   Body language and proximity
-   Gestures and eye contact
-   Speaking patterns and tone
-   Actions and reactions
-   **Can you think of others?**

::: notes
-   Make this interactive - ask students to volunteer additional cues they use
-   Have them discuss with a partner how they "read" other people
:::

## What Can We Actually Tell from Watching? {background-color="#3E2F5B"}

-   Joint vs. independent actions
-   Power dynamics and social status
-   Level of intimacy and rapport
-   Emotional states and attitudes
-   Type of relationship (strangers, friends, family)
-   Cultural norms and violations

::: notes
-   Explain each item with examples relevant to high school students
-   E.g., how can you tell who's popular, who's dating, who's arguing?
:::

## Our Brains on People-Watching {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559757175-7cb05f6d89e5?q=80&w=1000" background-opacity="0.3"}

Three brain networks work together:

1.  **Person Perception Network**: Processes faces and bodies
2.  **Action Perception Network**: Understands actions and movements
3.  **Mentalizing Network**: Interprets mental states and intentions

::: notes
-   Explain in simple terms how our brains have specialized systems for social perception
-   Compare to having different apps that work together on a phone
:::

## The Marketing Connection

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Companies like Coca-Cola use our people-watching instincts in advertisements:

-   Show intimate moments between people
-   Trigger our social analysis systems
-   Make us feel connected to the product
-   Leverage our desire to be part of positive interactions
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Coca-Cola ad showing social connection](https://i.imgur.com/example.jpg)
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Discuss how ads often show people interacting rather than just the product
-   Ask students to recall ads that use social scenarios to sell products
:::

## Quick Activity: Spot the Relationship

*As I show each image, write down:*

1.  What type of relationship do you think these people have?
2.  How do you know?
3.  What clues are you using?

::: notes
-   Show 3-4 images of different interactions (friends, romantic partners, strangers, etc.)
-   Have students jot down observations and discuss with a partner
-   Then discuss as a group, noting common patterns in observations
:::

## Are We Actually Good at People-Watching? {background-color="#254441"}

-   Consider cultural and contextual factors
-   Be aware of your own biases and expectations
-   Look for details in behavior and responses

::: notes
-   Frame people-watching as a skill that can be developed
-   Emphasize the ethical aspects (respect for privacy, avoiding judgmentalism)
:::

## The Future of People-Watching Research

**Exciting new directions:**

-   Cross-cultural studies of social perception
-   How virtual interactions change our people-watching abilities
-   Neural mechanisms of real-time social analysis
-   How our social perceptions influence our behavior
-   Using VR to study encounter-based impressions

::: notes
-   Highlight that this is a growing field with many unanswered questions
-   Mention opportunities for students interested in psychology, neuroscience, or sociology
:::

## Why This Matters

People-watching is more than entertainment:

-   It helps us understand complex social dynamics
-   It provides a window into how our brains process social information
-   It reveals biases and cultural differences in perception
-   It connects to fundamental questions about what makes us human
-   It has countless applications in the real world

::: notes
-   Wrap up by emphasizing the significance of this research
-   Connect back to students' everyday experiences
:::

2.  Record your observations and impressions
3.  Note what specific cues led to your conclusions
4.  Reflect on any assumptions you might have made
5.  Compare notes with friends - did they notice the same things?

::: notes
-   Provide a simple, ethical activity students can try
-   Emphasize respectful observation in public places only
-   Suggest they might notice new things after this presentation

## Experimental Paradigms {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553835973-dec43bfddbeb?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1770&q=80" background-opacity="0.2"}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Encounter Categorization Task**

-   Participants classify interactions into types
-   Measures accuracy and response time
-   Example categories:
    -   Cooperative vs. competitive
    -   Formal vs. intimate
    -   Dominant vs. equal status
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Encounter Prediction Task**

-   Participants predict how an interaction will unfold
-   View partial information (beginning of interaction)
-   Predict next actions or relationship outcomes
-   Tests understanding of social dynamics
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   These paradigms measure how accurately people can "read" social situations
-   Explain that reaction time gives insight into automatic vs. deliberate processing
-   Connect to real-world situation where we need to quickly assess social dynamics
:::

## The "Thin Slices" Methodology {background-color="#0F3057"}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**How it works:** \* Observers view brief (10-30 second) clips of interactions \* Make judgments about relationships, traits, or outcomes \* Judgments are compared to actual outcomes or self-reports \* Measures the accuracy of rapid social perception

**Key research question:** How much social information can we extract from minimal exposure?

**Research Questions:** \* Are some social perceptions universal? \* How do cultural norms affect interpretation? \* Which cues are culturally specific? \* Can people accurately read interactions from other cultures?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Methodology:** \* Show identical interactions to people from different cultures \* Compare perception accuracy across cultures \* Analyze culture-specific interpretation biases \* Test for universal vs. culture-specific cues
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Place et al. (2012) found that detecting romantic interest is a cross-cultural ability
-   Some social cues appear to be universal, while others are culturally specific
-   This methodology helps separate innate from learned aspects of social perception
:::

## The Two-Strategy Hypothesis {background-color="#1A1A2E"}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**How do we process social interactions?**

**Feature-Based Processing** \* Extract specific visual components \* Analyze individual cues (e.g., number of smiles) \* Process components separately \* Build up interpretation from parts

**Template-Based Processing** \* Compare to stored patterns of typical interactions \* Process interactions holistically \* Use prior expectations to guide perception \* Recognize patterns from minimal information
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Research Findings:** \* 6-month-olds notice "irrational" interactions \* 12-month-olds have expectations about social goals \* 18-month-olds imitate observed interactions \* Social perception develops before language
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Explain each methodology (e.g., babies look longer at unexpected events)
-   These methods reveal that social perception is present very early in development
-   Findings suggest some aspects of people-watching may be innate or develop very early
