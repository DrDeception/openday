- Black and white
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

  - Theory of mind
  - Working memory
:::

::: {.fragment}
**First causal proof** that deception training enhances cognition
:::

---

## The Neuroscience of Deception

# Part 2: The Social Functions {background-color="#7c2d12"}

## Prosocial Deception as Social Lubricant

---

## DePaulo's Groundbreaking Research

::: {.incremental}
