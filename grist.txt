## Introduce yourself, Gordon {background-color="#333333"}

-   Unfortunately, none of the interesting psychologists are here today.

-   So you are stuck with me.

-   I am sorry to say that I spend lots of my time lecturing **Research Methods and Statistics.**

## What is People-Watching?

::: r-fit-text
> "I like to watch people. Sometimes I ride the subway all day and look at them and listen to them. I just want to figure out who they are and what they want and where they're going."
:::

::: attribution
â€” Ray Bradbury, *Fahrenheit 451*
:::

::: notes
-   Start by asking students if they've ever people-watched
-   Explain that this common pastime is actually a sophisticated cognitive process
:::

## More Than Just a Pastime {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1533779283484-8ad4940aa3a8?q=80&w=1000" background-opacity="0.4"}

People-watching is **central to our social existence**

-   We observe others to gather information
-   We form impressions within seconds
-   Our brains are wired to analyze social interactions
-   These impressions affect how we interact with others

::: notes
-   Emphasize that people-watching isn't just entertainment
-   It's a fundamental cognitive skill that helps us navigate our social world
-   Ask students when they might people-watch (cafes, airports, school hallways)
:::

## The Science of "Third-Party Encounters" {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional Research**

-   Focused on impressions of isolated individuals
-   Usually just faces or single people
-   Missed the complexity of social interactions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**New Research Direction**

-   Studies how we observe interactions between others
-   Views interactions as the unit of analysis
-   Recognizes the richness of encounter-based impressions
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Explain that "Third-Party Encounters" (TPEs) is the scientific term for watching people interact
-   Mention that this is a relatively new and exciting area of research
:::

## Brain Game: Reading Social Clues

What clues do we use when people-watching? Let's see how many you can identify!

-   Physical appearances and facial expressions
-   Body language and proximity
-   Gestures and eye contact
-   Speaking patterns and tone
-   Actions and reactions
-   **Can you think of others?**

::: notes
-   Make this interactive - ask students to volunteer additional cues they use
-   Have them discuss with a partner how they "read" other people
:::

## What Can We Actually Tell from Watching? {background-color="#3E2F5B"}

-   Joint vs. independent actions
-   Power dynamics and social status
-   Level of intimacy and rapport
-   Emotional states and attitudes
-   Type of relationship (strangers, friends, family)
-   Cultural norms and violations

::: notes
-   Explain each item with examples relevant to high school students
-   E.g., how can you tell who's popular, who's dating, who's arguing?
:::

## Our Brains on People-Watching {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559757175-7cb05f6d89e5?q=80&w=1000" background-opacity="0.3"}

Three brain networks work together:

1.  **Person Perception Network**: Processes faces and bodies
2.  **Action Perception Network**: Understands actions and movements
3.  **Mentalizing Network**: Interprets mental states and intentions

::: notes
-   Explain in simple terms how our brains have specialized systems for social perception
-   Compare to having different apps that work together on a phone
:::

## The Marketing Connection

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Companies like Coca-Cola use our people-watching instincts in advertisements:

-   Show intimate moments between people
-   Trigger our social analysis systems
-   Make us feel connected to the product
-   Leverage our desire to be part of positive interactions
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Coca-Cola ad showing social connection](https://i.imgur.com/example.jpg)
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Discuss how ads often show people interacting rather than just the product
-   Ask students to recall ads that use social scenarios to sell products
:::

## Quick Activity: Spot the Relationship

*As I show each image, write down:*

1.  What type of relationship do you think these people have?
2.  How do you know?
3.  What clues are you using?

::: notes
-   Show 3-4 images of different interactions (friends, romantic partners, strangers, etc.)
-   Have students jot down observations and discuss with a partner
-   Then discuss as a group, noting common patterns in observations
:::

## Are We Actually Good at People-Watching? {background-color="#254441"}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**When we're accurate:**

-   Judging whether people know each other
-   Detecting romantic interest
-   Recognizing power differences
-   Identifying basic emotions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**When we make mistakes:**

-   Overrelying on stereotypes
-   Misreading cultural differences
-   Assuming internal states from external behavior
-   Projecting our own expectations
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Discuss why we might misinterpret what we see
-   Connect to real-life experiences students might have had
:::

## The Social Intelligence Hypothesis

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Did social complexity drive brain evolution?**

-   Humans have uniquely complex social structures
-   Keeping track of many relationships requires cognitive power
-   Our large brains may have evolved partly to handle social computations
-   People-watching skills appear very early in development
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Brain evolution illustration](https://i.imgur.com/example2.jpg)
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Explain how even 6-month-old infants show surprise at "irrational" social interactions
-   Connect to evolutionary advantages of understanding social dynamics
:::

## Real-World Applications {.smaller}

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
**Clinical Psychology**

-   Assessing social-cognitive functioning
-   Diagnosing conditions like autism
-   Designing better therapies
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
**Education**

-   Improving observational learning
-   Understanding classroom dynamics
-   Designing better social skills programs
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
**Technology**

-   Training AI to understand human interactions
-   Developing more natural robots
-   Improving virtual reality experiences
:::
::::::

::: notes
-   Emphasize the many practical applications of this research
-   Connect to potential career paths students might find interesting
:::

## People-Watching Skills Challenge

**How can you become a better people-watcher?**

-   Practice observing without jumping to conclusions
-   Notice patterns across different situations
-   Consider cultural and contextual factors
-   Be aware of your own biases and expectations
-   Look for details in behavior and responses

::: notes
-   Frame people-watching as a skill that can be developed
-   Emphasize the ethical aspects (respect for privacy, avoiding judgmentalism)
:::

## The Future of People-Watching Research

**Exciting new directions:**

-   Cross-cultural studies of social perception
-   How virtual interactions change our people-watching abilities
-   Neural mechanisms of real-time social analysis
-   How our social perceptions influence our behavior
-   Using VR to study encounter-based impressions

::: notes
-   Highlight that this is a growing field with many unanswered questions
-   Mention opportunities for students interested in psychology, neuroscience, or sociology
:::

## Why This Matters

People-watching is more than entertainment:

-   It helps us understand complex social dynamics
-   It provides a window into how our brains process social information
-   It reveals biases and cultural differences in perception
-   It connects to fundamental questions about what makes us human
-   It has countless applications in the real world

::: notes
-   Wrap up by emphasizing the significance of this research
-   Connect back to students' everyday experiences
:::

## Try It Yourself!

**Mini-experiment for the next week:**

1.  Spend 10 minutes people-watching in a public place
2.  Record your observations and impressions
3.  Note what specific cues led to your conclusions
4.  Reflect on any assumptions you might have made
5.  Compare notes with friends - did they notice the same things?

::: notes
-   Provide a simple, ethical activity students can try
-   Emphasize respectful observation in public places only
-   Suggest they might notice new things after this presentation
:::

## Thank You!
