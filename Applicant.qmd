## Research Methods & Statistics

This module offers the nuts and bolts of conducting and interpreting different kinds of research.

These fundamental research skills are highly valued by graduate employers. Whether you want to be a psychologist, a research scientist, an entrepreneur or an Olympic athlete, developing the skills to conduct quality research and analyse data will serve you well.

**You will be assessed via:** \* Lab-book of exercises â€“ practice works! \* 2 lab reports \* In person multiple-choice exam

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mental Health and Wellbeing

This module offers an introduction to psychological wellbeing and the emotional experience of being human.

Assessments are designed to help you connect psychological theory, scientific evidence and your personal development now and in the future.

**You will be assessed via:** \* Evidence-based action plan for student wellbeing \* Written description of a behavioural experiment; applying psychological theory in an experiential learning exercise to change a personal belief or behaviour.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cognition & Culture

This module offers an overview of what cognition is and the ways it can be applied in different real-world contexts.

Assessments are designed to enable you to work in groups and individually to present an argument for a non-technical audience. Teamwork and clear communication are essential skills in graduate-level employment.

## Identity, Agency & Environment

This Semester 1 module will enable you to develop critical thinking skills through various topics:

Hello students of **Identity Agency Environment 1 (IAE1)** - this module is subtitled ***Critical Thinking***. Welcome to the module and to your new year at Goldsmiths.

Every week this module will introduce you to a new, compelling, topical subject in a lecture, followed by interdisciplinary seminar groups, where you will explore your critical thinking capacities and engage with peers in discussions about topics you are presented with.

Your assessment at the close of the semester will be to respond critically to one of these topics in a way that feels purposeful and useful for you. You might decide to express your ideas about the topic of your choice by writing an essay, song, poem or composition, or by making a podcast, film, or designing a poster.
