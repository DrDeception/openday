# Welcome to Real Psychology {background-color="#1a202c"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Strategic Deception & People-Watching**
:::

::: {.fragment}
*Prepare to have your assumptions challenged*
:::

---

## Before We Start... {background-color="#2d3748"}

### **A Warning:**

::: {.incremental}
- Today you'll learn skills that could be **misused**
- We're teaching you **for protection**, not manipulation
- With knowledge comes **responsibility**
- Psychology is **powerful** - use it ethically
:::

### **Our Goal:**
Transform you from psychology **consumers** to psychological **scientists**

---

# DEMONSTRATION 1: Die Under the Cup {background-color="#4a5568"}

---

## The Setup {background-color="#2d3748"}

### **I need a volunteer!**

**The Challenge:**

- I'll place a die under an opaque cup
- You'll "guess" the number showing
- But I'm going to **help** you guess correctly
- **WITHOUT** saying a word about the die
- **WITHOUT** looking at the die myself

**Ready to see some "mind-reading"?**

---

## Let's Do This! {background-color="#1a202c"}

**[LIVE DEMONSTRATION]**

*Volunteer comes up, die is placed, "mind-reading" occurs*

---

## What Just Happened? {background-color="#2d3748"}

### **Audience - What Did You Observe?**

::: {.incremental}
- What did I do with my body?
- Where did I look?
- How did I position myself?
- What questions did I ask?
- How did the volunteer respond?
:::

### **Let's Analyze This Like Scientists...**

---

## The Science Behind the "Magic" {background-color="#4a5568"}

### **Multiple Techniques at Work:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Cold Reading**: Statistical guessing + feedback
- **Body Language Reading**: Micro-expressions and reactions
- **Ideomotor Effect**: Unconscious physical responses
- **Arousal & Leakage**: subtle physiological responses
- **Psychological Pressure**: Motivational impairment
- **Statistical Probability**: Working with likely outcomes
:::

::: {.fragment}
**This isn't magic - it's applied psychology!**
:::

---

## The Ideomotor Effect {background-color="#2d3748"}

::: {.demo-box}
### **Quick Demo: The Pendulum**

*[Demonstration with pendulum or ring on string]*

**Your unconscious mind moves your hand based on expectations**
- Think "yes" ‚Üí pendulum swings one way
- Think "no" ‚Üí pendulum swings another way
- **You're not consciously controlling it**

**Same principle applies to die guessing - micro-movements give away answers**

## A-Level vs University Thinking {background-color="#2d3748"}

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### **A-Level View:**
- Lying = morally wrong
- Honesty = always best
- Simple moral judgments
- Black and white thinking
- "Good people don't lie"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### **University View:**
- Deception = complex cognitive skill
- Multiple functions and contexts
- Sophisticated analysis needed
- Evidence-based understanding
- "Strategic communication serves many purposes"
:::
::::::

---

## The Shocking Truth About Lying {background-color="#4a5568"}

### **Research Findings:**

::: {.incremental}
- Average person tells **1-2 lies per day**
- Most lies are **prosocial** (protecting others' feelings)
- Learning to lie **enhances cognitive abilities**
- Deception requires **advanced executive function**
- Good liars have **superior theory of mind**
- Some lies actually **increase trust** between people
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Your brain on deception is your brain on advanced cognitive training!**
:::

---

## Cognitive Benefits of Deception Training {background-color="#2d3748"}

### **Ding et al. (2018) - Breakthrough Study:**

::: {.incremental}
- **42 children** randomly assigned to deception training
- **4 days** of strategic lying practice
- **Results**: Significant improvements in:
  - Executive function
  - Working memory
  - Theory of mind
  - Cognitive flexibility
:::

::: {.fragment}
**First causal proof that learning to deceive makes you smarter!**
:::

---

## What Your Brain Does When You Lie {background-color="#4a5568"}

### **The Cognitive Orchestra:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Suppress** the truthful response (inhibition)
2. **Generate** a plausible alternative (creativity)
3. **Track** both true and false information (working memory)
4. **Monitor** the target's reactions (theory of mind)
5. **Manage** your own expressions (emotional regulation)
6. **Adapt** your story based on feedback (cognitive flexibility)
:::

::: {.fragment}
**This is advanced cognitive multitasking at its finest!**
:::

**Ready to put your people-watching skills to the test?**
:::

---

## The Scenarios {background-color="#4a5568"}

## Common Lie Detection Myths {background-color="#2d3748"}

### **Things That DON'T Indicate Lying:**

::: {.incremental}
- ‚ùå **Avoiding eye contact** (cultural variation)
- ‚ùå **Fidgeting or nervousness** (could be anxiety)
- ‚ùå **Touching nose/face** (just normal behavior)
- ‚ùå **Pausing before speaking** (could be thinking)
- ‚ùå **Changes in voice pitch** (emotional, not deceptive)
:::

::: {.fragment}
**TV shows have taught us wrong!**
:::

---

## What ACTUALLY Works: Cognitive Load Approach {background-color="#4a5568"}

### **Vrij's Research-Based Method:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Increase cognitive demand** on the storyteller
- **Truth-tellers** can handle extra cognitive load
- **Liars** struggle because they're already working hard
- **Ask unexpected questions** that break prepared scripts
- **Look for inconsistencies** in detailed narratives
:::

::: {.fragment}
**This gets 70%+ accuracy in lab studies!**
:::

---

## Competition Strategy Session {background-color="#2d3748"}

### **Evidence-Based Lie Detection Tips:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Listen for detail richness** - true stories have more sensory details
2. **Ask follow-up questions** - liars struggle with unexpected queries  
3. **Notice confidence levels** - overconfidence can indicate deception
4. **Watch for cognitive strain** - lying is mentally exhausting
5. **Look for micro-expressions** - brief flashes of real emotion
6. **Consider baseline behavior** - how does this person normally act?
