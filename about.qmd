## Today's Experiment: The Marshmallow Challenge

:::{.callout-important}
## The Task
Build the tallest free-standing structure using:
- 20 sticks of spaghetti
- 1 yard of tape
- 1 yard of string
- 1 marshmallow (must be on top!)
- Time limit: 18 minutes
:::

---

## Pre-Challenge Psychology Connections

:::{.incremental}
- **Group dynamics**: How do strangers form working relationships?
 - Social facilitation vs. social loafing
 - In-group formation
 - Status and power dynamics

- **Cognitive biases**:
 - Functional fixedness (seeing objects only for their intended use)
 - Planning fallacy (underestimating time needed)
 - Overconfidence effect

- **Decision-making under pressure**:
 - Impact of stress on cognitive performance
 - Satisficing vs. optimizing strategies
:::

---

## Predictions

:::{.callout-note}
## Think-Pair-Share
- Which type of group performs best in this challenge?
 - Business executives
 - Recent MBA graduates
 - Engineers and architects
 - Kindergarten children
- Why do you think this is the case?
:::

---

## Research Methods Preview

This challenge demonstrates core elements of psychological research:

:::{.incremental}
- **Variables**: 
 - Independent (group composition)
 - Dependent (tower height, completion)
 - Control (same materials, instructions)

- **Observation methods**:
 - Structured observation
 - Behavioral coding
 - Process analysis

- **Data analysis**:
 - Quantitative (height measurements)
 - Qualitative (group dynamics)
:::

---

## Observer Roles

Some of you will be observers rather than participants:

:::{.incremental}
- **Communication patterns**:
 - Who speaks? How often? Who listens?
 - Verbal vs. non-verbal communication
 
- **Decision-making processes**:
 - How are ideas generated and evaluated?
 - Is there evidence of groupthink?
 
- **Leadership emergence**:
 - Formal vs. informal leadership
 - Leadership styles (directive, participative)
 
- **Conflict resolution**:
 - How are disagreements handled?
 - Constructive vs. destructive conflict
:::

## Post-Challenge Analysis

### Tuckman's Stages of Group Development

:::{.incremental}
- **Forming**: Orientation, testing boundaries
- **Storming**: Conflict, resistance to task demands
- **Norming**: Development of group cohesion
- **Performing**: Functional role relatedness
- **Adjourning**: Completion and disengagement
:::

---

## Cognitive Biases in Action

:::{.callout-tip}
## What we observed
:::

:::{.incremental}
- **Planning fallacy**: Groups overestimated what they could accomplish
- **Functional fixedness**: Limited vision of how materials could be used
- **Overconfidence bias**: Initial certainty vs. final outcomes
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Continuing with failing approaches
:::

## Stress and Creativity

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Yerkes-Dodson Law: Optimal arousal
- Time pressure effects on divergent thinking
- Impact of evaluation apprehension
- Stress responses: Fight, flight, or freeze in team contexts

## The Research Behind the Challenge

:::{.incremental}
- **Collaborative problem-solving**:
 - Coordination costs vs. diversity benefits
 - Psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999)
 
- **Creative thinking principles**:
 - Divergent vs. convergent thinking phases
 - Prototype testing and iteration
 
- **Mindset research**:
 - Fixed vs. growth mindset (Dweck)
 - Impact on persistence and approach to failure
:::

---

## The Kindergarten Advantage

:::{.callout-important}
## Why children often outperform business students:
:::

:::{.incremental}
1. Rapid prototyping - testing early and often
2. No status management or impression concerns
3. Learning through play - less fear of failure
4. Less fixated on "one right way" to solve problems
5. Natural collaboration without hierarchy
:::

---

## Follow-up Activity: Design Your Experiment

:::{.callout-note}
## In groups, design a variation of this challenge to test:
:::

:::{.incremental}
- How would you modify the challenge to test a specific psychological variable?
- What would you measure and how?
- What hypotheses would you propose?
- What interventions might improve performance?
