## Introduce yourself, Gordon {background-color="#333333"}

-   Unfortunately, none of the interesting psychologists are here today.

-   So you are stuck with me.

-   I am sorry to say that I spend lots of my time lecturing **Research Methods and Statistics.**

-   We take that seriously here at Goldsmiths.

## We are just about to introduce next year's Y2 research topics {background-color="#333333"}

-   Independent choice of topics

-   Work as a group

-   Run a real exxperiment using Qual and Quant techniques

-   And yes, Analyse the data!

## This year was a bit of a nightmare...

Let me tell you why!
